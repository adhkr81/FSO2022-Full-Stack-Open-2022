Full Stack Open 2022 - MOOC - University of Helsinki
This is the University of Helsinkiâ€™s free massive open online course (MOOC) on Web Development.

Full Stack Open 2022 : Learn React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL and TypeScript in one go! This course will introduce you to modern JavaScript-based web development. The main focus is on building single page applications with ReactJS that use REST APIs built with Node.js.

Those present in the repo are my solutions to the exercises.
